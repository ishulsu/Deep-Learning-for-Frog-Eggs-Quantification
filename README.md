This repository stores three separate models our team has made over the Summer of 2023 in Math 4997.
The Starter Model was made from scratch with what we had learned. The model worked, but did not predict well to our testing images.
A team member had found a working model with data similar to ours. This library is called StarDist. https://github.com/stardist/stardist
We then used StarDist to develop our own working version. Our first version of the model contained only 17 images of data and was suprisingly effective at predicting.
The second version is refined and contains a total of 180 images of data. We added in testing code for metrics to determine how well the model was working on our data.
Made by the DeVision Team under Dr. Wolenski's guidance.
